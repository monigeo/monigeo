Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Monica Sousa. I am geographer and I have been working on remoting sensing for 10 yeas. Currently, I am looking for enlarge and increase my knowledge in a different area, which is information Technology. Last year I started a new graduation in analysis and systems development. But I have been deepening my studies on my own for longer than that. I am a curious and proactive person when I am looking to learn new things.
